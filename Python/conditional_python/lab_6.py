# Conditional Expressions.
# use conditional expressions (also known as ternary operators) to simplify conditional assignments into a single line of code.

#1. Basic Conditional Expression:

age= 18
message = "adult" if age >=18 else "minor"
print(message)

# 2. Conditional Expression with Multiple Conditions:
score= 88
result= "pass" if score > 55 else "fail"
print(result)
